Once you [know who it is within a university]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-03-how-to-advertise-your-job-to-computer-science-students %}) that can promote your vacancies to students you probably will need to send them something to forward on. We previously talked about the fact that [there's a big risk that you'll be ignored]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-21-your-graduate-recruitment-depends-on-the-good-will-of-a-grumpy-academic %}) if you don't approach them in the correct way.

Employers and recruiters send job adverts in a number of ways:

- Include information about the job in the text of your email
- Forward a PDF or Word Document of the advert
- Send a link to a website with your job advert
- Don't forward any information about the role

Which of these is best? Unfortunately this is a _'it depends'_ type question.

What is best is whatever is easiest for the recipient to forward to the students. 

1. Commonly there will be an email list for finalists that they'll send an email to. In this case they'll need something they can copy and paste or attach to that email. 
1. Sometimes there is a forum/site where jobs are posted. I have used LinkedIn and our Virtual Learning Environment for this. In this case PDFs or other documents are awkward. I have to try to extract the text and reformat it into whatever the system will accept. 
1. Who knows what other approaches people use and whether certain formats are good or bad for them.

## Simple rules for how to send a job advert

1. Text intermingled with your email to us is always bad. Give us something that we can easily extract.
1. Links to your own advert on the web are always easy to work with. However, you should also give a paragraph and title that we can use to entice students to click that link.
1. Ask the person that will forward it what format they want.

## Bonus Rule

1 in 3 times that an employer asks me to advertise a role for them I have to ask them "how do you want students to apply?". Sometimes we're happy to be part of the recruitment process, sometimes you don't want us involved. If you know how you want to them to apply (e.g. an email directly to you including a CV) let us know when you contact us. In the worst case (and I think it's common) nobody tells students how to apply and so nobody does.
