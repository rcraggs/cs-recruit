On a university campus at any time of the year, you’ll see large employers giving away freebies. This brand marketing may not seem necessary since students are already aware of major brands; BBC, BP, Barclays, etc.

> "3 times as many students said they would apply for a graduate role at a particular company than another similar employer after that SME had mentioned their company during a Computer Science lecture."

Most students haven’t heard of a lot of SMEs. Even an SME with a strong brand has two problems when it comes to attracting students:


1. Your brand is only known within your industry,
2. Your brand is designed to attract clients, who are very different from students.

In a study which we’ll discuss in a future article, three times as many students said they would apply for a particular company over another, similar employer after that SME was mentioned during a single Computer Science lecture. There was an even bigger difference for a company that promoted themselves more than once. The effect was shown to last for months after the company was promoted.

It’s clear that promoting employers prior to advertising graduate roles has a big impact on the number of applicants. The answer to the question in the title of this post is a resounding “Yes!”.

The good news is that because you need to target a specific demographic, and one that happens to be the captive audience of their university department, it’s much easier than marketing your brand to clients or the general public. In many future articles we’ll look at how and when you can do this.
