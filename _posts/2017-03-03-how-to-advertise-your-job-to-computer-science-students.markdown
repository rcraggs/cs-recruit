Advertising graduate roles is not like other recruiting. Posting on a job board or your own site won't work. You must get the right person at a university to email students directly. 

The final step of the [3 step approach to recruiting better students]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-24-three-steps-to-better-graduates %}) was to advertise a role in the right way. The most important part of advertising is ensuring your target audience _see_ what you want them to. Most students are not used to seeking out opportunities. Universities are so keen to be seen to provide great service to students, any events or opportunities are clearly sign-posted, with regular reminders. Large employers reinforce this by turning up on campus to hand out application forms (and sweeties).

> You too must therefore be able to directly contact students, or at least get someone within a university to do this for you. 

Many universities have internal jobs boards and will post your advert. However unless a student is in a job-hunting fervour, they are unlikely to check. Most universities can email students directly, if you find the person with the authority and willingness to do this. These are usually:

1. Someone in a central careers service that is responsible for graduate jobs in science and technology.
2. Someone within the academic department who has a specific "careers" role or who just values graduate employment.

Careers services offer an all-round service and may be willing to screen CVs, arrange interviews etc. However graduate employment is a [numbers game](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-and-employment-destination-data-published) and if you have only 1 or 2 vacancies you may not interest the central careers service. Academic departments have other reasons to work with 'industry' so can be more willing to talk with smaller companies. Also, emails send from their own department tend to get noticed by students.

For the best chance of getting you vacancy in front of the right students:

**First try to find the right person in the computer science department**

If you search for "`Computer Science X university`" you'll find their website [(example)](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=computer+science+bristol+university&oq=Computer+Science+bristol+univ). You should be able to find a phone number or email address from there. Some departments will have a page especially for employers. Call and ask who you should speak to about advertising graduate roles. 

If they don't respond positively then you should try central careers.

**Contacting central careers**

Similarly, you can find a university's careers service easily on Google. In most cases there will be page specifically employers on how to get in touch.

In either case, you should ask them to send an email directly to students rather than posting an advert on their jobs board.   

What to include in an email to students, and when it should be sent is an art and a science in itself and we'll cover this in detail in future articles.
