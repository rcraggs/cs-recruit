excerpt: "How businesses make money isn't obvious, especially the services industry. Don't assume students will understand how your business works, even if you explain it."

By the time they students graduate, most are 21 or older, they are adults. You may have met 21 or 22 year old employees and assume that students applying for graduate jobs are similar. However computer science graduates must learn so much in the first months of employment that they become almost unrecognisable from those applying for roles who are between 6 and 12 months younger in age but seemingly 2-3 years less mature. 

If you are trying to recruit such students, it's worth being aware of ways in which this "not-quite-maturity" exhibits itself. It will help when you're communicating with them, and it will help you to differentiate between genuine warning signs from more common issues.

One thing that appears to surprise many employers is: **Most students won't understand your business model**

I hear employers talking to students about 'our clients' and 'our services'. This will go over the heads of many students who are just not familiar with how much of the IT industry works. Students understand products; you create a app and sell it on the app-store for £1, if 1000 people download the app you generate £1000. 

However it's likely that the concepts of tendering, fixed-price v.s. time and material, support contracts and warranties will never have been raised during their degree. Truthfully many academics that have never worked outside of a university will not understand these either. If you are communicating with a Computer Science student, even one that has researched your company, don't assume that you can explain how you make money without first explaining how the services industry works.

[This article in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/dec/18/my-students-have-paid-9000-and-now-they-think-they-own-me) provides some evidence for this. A lecturer (bitterly) complains that students feel that all of their £9,000 tuition fee should pay for direct contact time with a lecturer, ignoring the overheads or running a university. 

Employers sometimes worry that a placement student or graduate recruit doesn't care enough about the importance of making money and approaches their work accordingly. The truth is, they probably don't yet understand _how_ you make money.

Be careful when writing job adverts or presenting to students. It may be worth checking with their lecturers first.
