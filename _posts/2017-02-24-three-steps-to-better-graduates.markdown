**A worrying observation:** Many good students don't notice a job advert for a suitable role, even when it is emailed to them directly. If all you do is ask universities to 'circulated' adverts or even worse, expect students to find your advert on-line, you will not get many applications.

Last year a talented and outgoing student visited my office in June because she had not yet managed to secure a graduate role. She was not a confident programmer so was unsure of the types of roles should could apply for. After discussing her skills and interests I was able to connect her with a company that were thrilled to employ her. A nice little success story. 

I asked her, _"Did you not see the job advert for this exact role that was sent couple of months ago?"_. She replied _"We get a lot of email"_.

Getting students to notice your vacancies and respond requires you to pro-active and strategic about how you target and communicate with universities and their students.  

The basic 3-step strategy is:

1. Identify the 3 or 4 universities on which you would like to focus your recruitment.
1. Develop a strong, reciprocal relationship with the appropriate departments.
1. Advertise your roles at the right time, in the right way. 

We'll focus on unpacking each of these steps in upcoming articles. 

If you are currently just mass-emailing a job advert to people across multiple universities then there is a lot of benefit that can you get just from step 3 (for instance what format are you sending the job advert in?!). However if you do all three your level of success will sky-rocket.
