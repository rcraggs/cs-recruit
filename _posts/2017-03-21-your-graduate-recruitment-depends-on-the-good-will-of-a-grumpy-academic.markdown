Recruiters have started trying to scam me into promoting their graduate roles. 

This year I have I have noticed several similar emails from large employers saying things like _"you recently advertised our role, but we have not had any applicants"_ or _"we usually have many applicants from your department and this year we have had none"_. 

> Academics have many faults, but being stupid isn't one of them

How likely do you think I am to actively promote a job advert that comes to me in that way?

**Here's your problem:** University careers services are highly motived to help students find graduate jobs but can have limited access to them. Academics have unfettered access to students and some authority over them, but limited time and incentive to help students find jobs. This last comment may seem shocking - _academics don't care about helping students find jobs?!_. The work-life and career progression of academics is arcane and confusing. Suffice to say that for most academics, promoting your graduate vacancies comes somewhere down the priority list between placating students that are unhappy with their grades and The Times crossword.

This is worth remembering when you get in touch with academics to advertise your roles. 

## Hints for fostering the good will of an academic 

1. They may not feel obliged to respond to your email. Do not give them a reason to just delete it; especially making it appear you are trying to scam them.
1. Be respectful of their time. Don't let your initial contact be a long email or a request to arrange a meeting.
1. Find out who is the right person and contact them directly. Don't blanket email a department.
1. Be aware of, and acknowledge the fact that most academics will consider that you are asking them to do you a favour (even if you think it's the other way around).
